About
============

Pybald is a light weight, python, `MVC <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller>`_ style web framework. It is inspired by work done by `Ian Bicking <http://blog.ianbicking.org/>`_, and builds upon the concepts presented in `Another do-it-yourself framework <http://pythonpaste.org/webob/do-it-yourself.html>`_. It is also takes design inspiration from `Ruby on Rails <http://rubyonrails.org>`_ and `Django <http://www.djangoproject.com/>`_. It's something of a spiritual successor to Pylons.
